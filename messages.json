Falder, who operated under various online identities, including 'Liz' and 'evilmind,' exploited over 50 victims by manipulating them into humiliating and abusive acts. His crimes were so extensive that it took over 30 minutes to read out the charges against him in court. Falder engaged in extreme online abuse, including blackmail, sadism, and paedophilia, leading some of his victims to attempt suicide. He believed he was untouchable, often expressing indifference to whether his victims lived or died.\n\nThe investigation into Falder's crimes involved multiple international agencies and lasted four years. Despite facing 188 charges, he pleaded guilty to 137 offenses against 46 victims, making him one of the most prolific sex offenders in British history. On February 19, 2018, Falder was sentenced to 32 years in prison, with an additional 6 years on extended license. He will not be eligible for parole until he is at least 50 years old, and may serve the full sentence if deemed a continued threat. The judge described him as a \"warped and sadistic\" individual who took pleasure in the suffering of others.",

You should NEVER use a service or website to remove the exif/metadata for you! Don't do it. just think of it in this way: You're literally giving them with the picture your exif/metadata. No one knows who's really operating these services. (healthy paranoia)\nSo we gonna do it manually which is so easy to do\n\nTails\nTails provides a very handy tool to remove EXIF data, right click on the image file you wish to remove it from and then remove metadata.\nTails already comes with MAT2 (Metadata Anonymization Toolkit v2).\nMAT2 removes all exif or metadata from files leaving them empty, nothing to see. and it works for files too not just pictures such as (.docx, .pptx, .xlsx .torrent .flac .mp3 etc..) by simply right clicking your file and then hitting \"remove metadata\".\n\nWindows (Which you shouldn't use for DN activity)\n\nThis time am gonna spare you the lecture of you should not use Windows, and since you made it this far on DN and looking for how to remove your exif/metadata this is the easy steps on Windows as following\n1.Right-click on the picture and choose “Properties.”\nhttp://2.Click the “Details” tab. At the bottom of the “Details” tab, you'll see a blue link titled “Remove Properties and Personal Information.”\n3.On the Remove Properties section, select the Remove the following properties from this file option.\nhttp://4.Click the Select All to remove all potential properties.\n\nLinux\n\nThe metadata can be seen in Linux with many apps. Depending on your software set, there is a great chance that you have an app which can display it. For example, Ristretto and Thunar can show this info in image properties.\n\n1.For your convenience, place all image you want to process to the single folder.\n2.Navigate to that folder.\nhttp://3.Open a new terminal and run the following command:\nmogrify -strip your_filename.jpg\n\nThis will remove the meta data from a single specific picture.\n\nhttp://4.To process all files at once, execute the command\n\nmogrify -strip ./*.jpg\n\nAnd now you're good to go. take a look at Images Upload Sites⚠️ post if you still looking for onions sites to upload your pictures.",

Dread Link: http://dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/post/998f8e87e903409c1244\n\nImages of the thread are at the very botoom.\n\nStep By Step Guide: How To Remove Exif/Metadata From Your Picture.\nby /u/EmpBomb P MOD • 3 years ago* in /d/Reviews\nIn this Step by Step guide I will show you the ultimate way to remove exif/metadata that's embedded in your picture.\nWhat Is EXIF Metadata?\nMetadata connected to photos is stored in a format called “Exchangeable Image File Format” or EXIF. And the EXIF metadata include:\n\nLatitude and longitude coordinates for the location where the photo was taken (GPS Coordinates)\nCamera settings like ISO speed, shutter speed, focal length, aperture, white balance, and lens type.\nThe make and model of the phone/camera.\nThe date and time the photo was taken.\nThe name and build of all programs used to view or edit the photo.\n\nSo basically, Metadata tells the world where, when, and most crucially, who uploaded it.\nFun fact: Believe or not but the internet is full of cropped or blurred images in which the included EXIF thumbnail still shows the original picture.\n\nYou gonna need to upload pictures for your Review (Especially in this Subdread) or to upload pictures supporting your drama-post on Dread subs showing chat screenshots or whatever, or even uploading picture to markets when you have a dispute and needs to show some prove for your claims.\nStep 1 (Before taking pictures)\nAll of us use smartphones, and smartphones will automatically save your location via GPS when you take any pictures. so before taking any pictures you need to disable this feature in your phone settings as following:\nAndroid\n1.Open the Settings app on your Android and look for either the \"Connections\" tab or, depending on your phone, the \"Privacy\" tab.\n2.Tap \"Location\" and toggle the switch to off.\n3.You can also tap \"Emergency Location Service\" and \"Google Location Sharing\" to switch off location-tracking features there as well.\niPhone & iPad (iOS)\n1.Go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services\n2.Make sure that Location Services is off.\n\nNow your smartphone will not add your GPS location to the picture. but you should never blindly trust them.\nAlso your exif/metadata will still have information that will trace back to you. and later in this guide rest assured we will remove all this exif/metadata.\n\nStep 2 (Taking pictures)\n\nPlease pay attention to your phone camera lens. Sometimes when your fingers is bit greasy from eating food or god knows what you were doing. you'll leave your fingerprints on the lens when you touch it.\nYes, you can't easily see it and it won't show on the picture, but trust me, it's there in the picture! And if LE's have the right resources which probably they do, and would like to dig deep with your pictures, they will have your fingerprint from the picture.\n\nSo, first thing you should do is make sure to clean your Phone camera.\n\nSecond thing, pay attention to the surrounding, make sure nothing in the picture that could profile/leads to you or your house.\nNow take your beautiful shots. After that you need to crop/edit the picture and mess around a little bit with Exposure, Contrast etc.. you can even use those ready made filters on your phone (Don't go crazy with editing, we need to see a good picture not chaos).\nWhat we're actually doing now with this editing is adding more layers to the original picture to make it more difficult to trace it back. You can skip this tip, it's all up to you. just sayin'\nFinished with your masterpiece? Great, now let's remove all your exif/metadata.\n\nStep 3 (Removing Exif/Metadata)\n\nThere's many apps and websites that remove your exif/metadata. they are good yeah but…. You should NEVER use a service or website to remove the exif/metadata",

Upon detecting the issue, the Company began taking steps to assess, contain and remediate the potentially unauthorized activity. On August 19, 2024, the Company determined that an unauthorized party disrupted the Company’s use of certain servers and some business operations. The Company promptly took additional steps to address the incident, including isolating the affected systems, shutting down certain systems, and launching an investigation with the assistance of external cybersecurity advisors.\n\nAs a result of the incident, certain of the Company’s manufacturing facilities are operating at less than normal levels, and the Company’s ability to fulfill orders is currently impacted. The Company is working diligently to bring the affected portions of its IT systems back online, restore normal business operations and mitigate the impact of the incident.\n\nAs the Company’s investigation is ongoing, the full scope, nature and impact of the incident are not yet known. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not yet determined whether the incident is reasonably likely to materially impact the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.",

It was originally hosted on CloudFlare, from what I remember, and it was essentially suspended by CF.\n\nThere currently isn't a new Clearnet site. However, subscribers on my platform always have a verified link to get too.\n\nYou can follow the conversation here: Dread: http://dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad[.]onion/post/0397292cfb6a0658a56d/",

The only time a scene leak will be posted is if the game, movie, etc. leaks before it's release date. So if Hackers were to release tomorrow on digital platform for the first time, and someone leaks it before tomorrow then it's a leak. These are very unique cases. A game can only be leaked once, until it comes out with various editions. Therefore a game being leaked online before it's release date is actually a big deal. ♥️",

One of the primary targets was the Arab National Bank (ANB), where we successfully disrupted the banking service portal for over seven hours.\n🤔The attacks we launch are powerful, lethal and advanced that belong to the fourth generation. Despite the fact that Saudi Arabia spends high amounts on protective firewalls/ WAF's/ DDoS Protection, they still remain incapable of stopping our attacks. \n🤔At this moment, a new and comprehensive attack is being prepared against the Saudi infrastructure, including financial and banking services.\n\n🔺🖤Hello Saudi government🐫 , I hope you are entertained by our attack this week and also hello to the princess Mohammed ben Salmane :) we're sure you like your new Jewish family.\n\n⚡️بتاريخ 19/08/2024، قمنا بتنفيذ هجوم مدمر استهدف البنية التحتية للمملكة العربية السعودية، وكان من أبرز الأهداف البنك العربي الوطني (Arab National Bank)، حيث تم تعطيل بوابة الخدمات المصرفية لأكثر من سبع ساعات. \n🤔نوعية الهجمات التي نشنها قوية، فتاكة، ومتطورة إلى الجيل الرابع، ورغم أن المملكة تصرف الملايين على جدران الحماية، إلا أنها غير قادرة على إيقاف هجماتنا. \n🤔حاليًا، يتم التحضير لهجوم شامل ومدمر جديد على البنية التحتية السعودية، بما في ذلك الخدمات المالية والمصرفية.\n\n#Darkmeta \n#sn_blackmeta \n#ElironNetworks",

If this was the case we would direct all our energy, knowledge and efforts in supporting the United States of America, becoming allies with Israel...\n\n🤔The result? We would be hailed as national heroes, champions of freedom and democracy, fighting terrorism and gaining privileges beyond imagination. We would benefit financially and live lives free from risks and troubles (although we love a challenge). We would have connections with business leaders and politicians and no one would call us \"a gang of criminal hackers\" or \"terrorists\"; instead, we would become symbols of progress and justice.\n\n➗🫥This is the law of the new world, the law of the strong who rule over the weak. But we are neither the strong nor the weak... We are the kings of the game, the armies of the oppressed and wronged. Our mission is not to establish justice in life, for that is a relative concept, but our mission is to silence those who think they are something when they are nothing. Where some of our attacks are labeled as criminal activity, we label it as the voices of freedom. \n\n⚪️Terrorism is a year-long genocide.\n⚪️Terrorism is the rape of lands without any right.\n⚪️Terrorism is the destruction of childhood dreams.\n⚪️Terrorism is accusing us of terrorism without a court or legal judgment.\n⚪️Terrorism is the right of white people and foreigners to international protection and diplomatic law, while people with brown and black skin are marginalized.\n⚪️Terrorism is destroying the homes of the innocent and the dreams of children.\n\n🏴‍☠️🇺🇸🇬🇧In the end, you are the terrorists.\n\n☄️🤔Note: Our group does not carry out attacks for money. That is a cheap media tactic to tarnish our great names. Our enemies will taste severe torment.\n\n🤍بالعربي:\n\n🌐رسالة من الماضي والحاضر إلى المستقبل\n\n🖤ما تعرفه هو قطرة، وما تجهله هو محيط.\n\n🤔تخيل معي اليوم، لو أن هذه المجموعة كانت تهدف إلى تدمير البنية التحتية للدول العربية، والتعاون مع حلف الناتو وأوروبا. نتوجه بكل طاقاتنا وعلومنا وجهودنا لدعم الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية، ونصبح حلفاء لإسرائيل...\n\n🤔النتيجة؟ سنكون أبطالاً قوميين، ممثلين للحرية والديمقراطية، نحارب الإرهاب ونحصل على امتيازات تتجاوز الخيال. سنستفيد من الأموال، ونحصل على جنسيات جديدة، ونعيش حياة آمنة من المخاطر والمشاكل (رغم حبنا للمشاكل). ستكون لنا علاقات مع رجال الأعمال والسياسيين، ولن يُطلق علينا لقب \"مجموعة الهاكرز المجرمين\" أو \"الإرهابيين\"، بل سنصبح رمزًا للتطور والعدل.\n\n➗🫥هذا هو قانون العالم الجديد، قانون الأقوياء الذين يحكمون الضعفاء. لكننا لسنا الأقوياء أو الضعفاء... نحن ملوك اللعبة، جيوش المستضعفين والمظلومين. مهمتنا ليست إقامة العدل في الحياة، فهذا مفهوم نسبي، بل مهمتنا هي إسكات من يظن أنه شيء وهو لا شيء. بعض الهجمات التي وُصفت بأنها إجرامية، نحن نعتبرها أصوات الحرية.\n\n⚪️الإرهاب هو سنة كاملة من الإبادة الجماعية.\n⚪️الإرهاب هو اغتصاب الأراضي دون أي حق.\n⚪️الإرهاب هو تدمير أحلام الطفولة.\n⚪️الإرهاب هو اتهامنا بالإرهاب دون محكمة أو حكم قانوني.\n⚪️الإرهاب هو حق البشر البيض والجنسيات الأجنبية في الحماية الدولية والقانون الدبلوماسي، بينما يُهمَّش البشر السمراء والسوداء.\n⚪️الإرهاب هو تدمير بيوت الأبرياء وأحلام الأطفال.\n\n🏴‍☠️🇺🇸🇬🇧وفي النهاية، أنتم الإرهاب.\n\n\n☄️🤔ملاحظة: مجموعتنا لا تنفذ هجمات لأجل المال. فهذا أسلوب إعلامي رخيص من اجل تشويه أسمائنا عظيمه....الأعداء سيتذوقون عذابًا عسيرًا.\n\n\n#Darkmeta \n#sn_blackmeta \n#ElironNetworks",

Certainly, within moments, Superman(usa) would appear and declare war on Russia, but he wouldn’t have the courage to do so. The question is ❓:  \n\n🫥Why did Israel bomb Iran without any Arab, European, or American response?\n\n⚡️From this, we can conclude that European, international, and American laws are unnecessary because the only law that governs is power and money. This cheap law is always used under the pretext of fighting terrorism. But when it comes to Israel, which uses guided missiles and violates the airspace of more than three countries, isn’t that terrorism? How can this be considered a heroic act?\n\n🔥Congratulations, you have earned the fires of hell from us.\n\n🫥السؤال الذي يطرح نفسه اليوم: لنفترض أن روسيا قامت بضرب فرنسا بصاروخ وأعلنت عن اغتيال الرئيس كروسون.في غضون لحظات، سيظهر البطل سوبرمان (أمريكا) ويعلن عن شن حرب ضد روسيا، لكن لا يملك الجُرأة لذلك. السؤال هو❓:\n\n🫥لماذا قامت دولة إسرائيل بقصف إيران دون أي رد عربي أو أوروبي أو أمريكي؟\n\n⚡️من هنا نستنتج أن القوانين الأوروبية والدولية والأمريكية ليست ذات ضرورة، لأن القانون الوحيد الذي يحكم هو القوة والمال. دائمًا ما يتم استخدام هذا القانون الرخيص تحت ذريعة مكافحة الإرهاب. ولكن بالنسبة لدولة إسرائيل، التي تقوم باستخدام صاروخ موجه واختراق المجال الجوي لأكثر من ثلاث دول، أليس هذا إرهاباً؟ كيف يُعتبر هذا عملاً بطولياً؟\n\n🔥مبارك عليكم، لقد ربحتم نار الجحيم منا.\n\n🎯EUROPOL, are you ready  ?\n\n⏳Duration: 5 hours \n\n🔺هجوم  سيبراني ضخم ومدمر على :\n\n🔽Europol (European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation) provides services related to coordinating and enhancing cooperation among police forces in EU member states to combat organized crime and terrorism. The site offers information about Europol's activities, joint operations, and security reports. It also provides data and resources to help authorities address security threats across Europe.\n\n\n🔽موقع Europol (الاتحاد الأوروبي للشرطة) يوفر خدمات تتعلق بتنسيق وتعزيز التعاون بين قوات الشرطة في الدول الأعضاء بالاتحاد الأوروبي لمكافحة الجريمة المنظمة والإرهاب. يقدم الموقع معلومات عن أنشطة Europol، العمليات المشتركة، والتقارير الأمنية. كما يعرض بيانات ومصادر لمساعدة السلطات في التصدي للتهديدات الأمنية عبر أوروبا.\n\n- We attacked all the systems + we burned the server and the network. ✂️\n\n🔴https://www.uptrends.com/tools/uptime?toolRequestGuid=13255242-8c89-442b-acd7-b09f95567c07\n\n🟡https://check-host.net/check-report/1cafad0dk855\n\n🟡https://check-host.net/check-report/1caf9eeaka89\n\n🟡https://check-host.net/check-report/1cafc71ckd05\n\n🟡https://check-host.net/check-report/1cafcd93k750\n\n🟡https://check-host.net/check-report/1cb00cefk17a\n\n#Darkmeta \n#sn_blackmeta \n#ElironNetworks",
