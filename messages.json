Upon detecting the issue, the Company began taking steps to assess, contain and remediate the potentially unauthorized activity. On August 19, 2024, the Company determined that an unauthorized party disrupted the Company’s use of certain servers and some business operations. The Company promptly took additional steps to address the incident, including isolating the affected systems, shutting down certain systems, and launching an investigation with the assistance of external cybersecurity advisors.\n\nAs a result of the incident, certain of the Company’s manufacturing facilities are operating at less than normal levels, and the Company’s ability to fulfill orders is currently impacted. The Company is working diligently to bring the affected portions of its IT systems back online, restore normal business operations and mitigate the impact of the incident.\n\nAs the Company’s investigation is ongoing, the full scope, nature and impact of the incident are not yet known. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not yet determined whether the incident is reasonably likely to materially impact the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.",

The only time a scene leak will be posted is if the game, movie, etc. leaks before it's release date. So if Hackers were to release tomorrow on digital platform for the first time, and someone leaks it before tomorrow then it's a leak. These are very unique cases. A game can only be leaked once, until it comes out with various editions. Therefore a game being leaked online before it's release date is actually a big deal. ♥️",

After not being able to locate the issue, a workaround is in place to restart the server every 2 days via cron and a script is run to shrink the database that the server uses to store information. I confirmed no further intervention is needed by me to do this, therefore monitoring the automation of this is all that is needed.\n\n🐛 Open Bugs:\n* [Minor]: When changing all images to have rounded corners it makes the images look stretched and not centered on the website/X/Telegram/LinkedIn.\n* [Minor]: X image previews on links are not center for the Feature image.\n* [Minor]: Add new tags next to new urls is not showing properly against the table.\n* [Minor]: Feature image on posts no longer zooms in/out after fixing previous image issues not zooming in and out properly specifically on posts. Workaround is to look down the post to see that initial image which can zoom in and out.",

If you're actively engaging in operations across various platforms like I do daily, it's crucial to mitigate any potential exposure through simple yet effective measures. One such measure is adjusting the time zone on your OS. By doing this, any screenshot you capture directly from your system (e.g., Telegram) will display a time that's not easily traceable to your actual location. This small step can add an additional layer of anonymity to your activities.",
