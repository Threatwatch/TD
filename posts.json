From this moment forward, we mobilize all teams within our great union to confront the Israeli occupation across all cyber fronts. We will strike the enemy using targeted methods, just as Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah declared: from Kiryat Shmona to Eilat. We stand united in the Holy League, joined by many brothers within the axis of Islamic Resistance, alongside NoName057(16) and UserSec. Lastly, the People's Cyber Army also stands ready.

Founded in 1951, it works to strengthen financial and political backing for Israel in the U.S. Congress. It is seen as playing a role in influencing American decisions that support Israel, including military funding and operations like the war in Gaza. However, AIPAC does not provide direct funding for wars, but it does influence policies that may support Israel militarily.🏴☠️🇺🇸⚡️هي مجموعة ضغط قوية في الولايات المتحدة تدعم العلاقات بين أمريكا وإسرائيل. تأسست عام 1951، وتعمل على تعزيز الدعم المالي والسياسي لإسرائيل في الكونغرس الأمريكي. يُنظر إليها على أنها تلعب دوراً في التأثير على القرارات الأمريكية التي تدعم إسرائيل، بما في ذلك التمويل العسكري والعمليات العسكرية مثل الحرب في غزة. ومع ذلك، فإن AIPAC لا تقدم تمويلاً مباشراً للحروب، لكنها تؤثر في السياسات التي قد تدعم إسرائيل عسكرياً🤔 هجوم مدمر يعطل الخدمات والتطبيق من الداخل والمواقع المرتبطه به⚪️Test power tool 35 million requests per second [Rps] 🤔/new upgrades ⚪️Results = Disabled services + crash login account + app crash. 👑Eliron Networks sponsored by Darkmeta ⭕Duration: To be confirmedNote: If the home page is visible, it is just cache.

Founded in 1951, it works to strengthen financial and political backing for Israel in the U.S. Congress. It is seen as playing a role in influencing American decisions that support Israel, including military funding and operations like the war in Gaza. However, AIPAC does not provide direct funding for wars, but it does influence policies that may support Israel militarily.🏴☠️🇺🇸⚡️هي مجموعة ضغط قوية في الولايات المتحدة تدعم العلاقات بين أمريكا وإسرائيل. تأسست عام 1951، وتعمل على تعزيز الدعم المالي والسياسي لإسرائيل في الكونغرس الأمريكي. يُنظر إليها على أنها تلعب دوراً في التأثير على القرارات الأمريكية التي تدعم إسرائيل، بما في ذلك التمويل العسكري والعمليات العسكرية مثل الحرب في غزة. ومع ذلك، فإن AIPAC لا تقدم تمويلاً مباشراً للحروب، لكنها تؤثر في السياسات التي قد تدعم إسرائيل عسكرياً🤔 هجوم مدمر يعطل الخدمات والتطبيق من الداخل والمواقع المرتبطه به⚪️Test power tool 35 million requests per second [Rps] 🤔/new upgrades ⚪️Results = Disabled services + crash login account + app crash. 👑Eliron Networks sponsored by Darkmeta ⭕Duration: To be confirmedNote: If the home page is visible, it is just cache.

(NPCV), a subsidiary of NIDEK Precision, was targeted by an external criminal group, resulting in a data breach. The attackers illegally accessed NPCV’s server, stealing over 50,000 documents and demanding a ransom. When the company did not comply, the stolen data, which included internal documents, contracts, and supplier letters, was published on a dark website, making it accessible to third parties. The attack exploited a compromised user ID and password to access the NPCV server via VPN. No secondary economic damage has been confirmed, and there have been no additional attacks since the initial breach. The company has taken immediate action, including suspending VPN operations, resetting passwords, and conducting system-wide scans to prevent further intrusions.Source:https://www.nidec.com/jp/nidec-precision/corporate/news/2024%E5%B9%B4/20241017%20incident2/",

Сыпется фронт, ВСУ несут большие потери среди личного состава и техники, которую Украине любезно продали ее партнеры. И если раньше Россия тянула захваченные трофеи сотни километров до мест изучения, то теперь украинские подразделения сами любезно доставляют западные образцы на территорию РФ, где они гораздо быстрее попадают в руки специалистов по их изучению. Не так давно к нам обратились именно такие люди с просьбой найти информацию по  БТР типа «KTO Rosomak» (Kołowy Transporter Ożarony Rosomak – «Колесный бронированный транспортер «Росомаха»). Польская машина «Росомаха» является доработанной версией финской бронемашины Patria AMV и выпускается по лицензии компанией Rosomak SA (входит в состав государственной группы Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa SA). В ВСУ они начали поставлятся с прошлого года. Польша заняла очень хитрую позицию в этом конфликте. Они одними из первых бросились помогать ВСУ и передавать им свою старую или некачественную технику. Взамен они теперь получают новую и более современную технику.Мы проинспектировали компьютеры ВСУ и нашли необходимые материалы. В технической документации подробно расписано, как правильно эксплуатировать польско-финский броневик, чтоб он без поломок своим ходом доехал до РФ. И мы знаем, что эта «экспресс-доставка трофеев» очень не нравятся западным партнерам этой самой техники, несмотря на полученные барыши от ее продажи. 😎",

For PMD entries that point to page tables and are fully coveredby the source address range, move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...) is called,which first takes rmap locks, then does move_normal_pmd(). move_normal_pmd() takes the necessary page table locks at source anddestination, then moves an entire page table from the source to thedestination.The problem is: The rmap locks, which protect against concurrent pagetable removal by retract_page_tables() in the THP code, are only takenafter the PMD entry has been read and it has been decided how to move it. So we can race as follows (with two processes that have mappings of thesame tmpfs file that is stored on a tmpfs mount with huge=advise); notethat process A accesses page tables through the MM while process B does itthrough the file rmap:process A                      process B=========                      =========mremap  mremap_to    move_vma      move_page_tables        get_old_pmd        alloc_new_pmd                      *** PREEMPT ***                               madvise(MADV_COLLAPSE)                                 do_madvise                                   madvise_walk_vmas                                     madvise_vma_behavior                                       madvise_collapse                                         hpage_collapse_scan_file                                           collapse_file                                             retract_page_tables                                               i_mmap_lock_read(mapping)                                               pmdp_collapse_flush                                               i_mmap_unlock_read(mapping)        move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...)          take_rmap_locks          move_normal_pmd          drop_rmap_locksWhen this happens, move_normal_pmd() can end up creating bogus PMD entriesin the line `pmd_populate(mm, new_pmd, pmd_pgtable(pmd))`.  The effectdepends on arch-specific and machine-specific details; on x86, you can endup with physical page 0 mapped as a page table, which is likelyexploitable for user->kernel privilege escalation.Fix the race by letting process B recheck that the PMD still points to apage table after the rmap locks have been taken.  Otherwise, we bail andlet the caller fall back to the PTE-level copying path, which will thenbail immediately at the pmd_none() check.Bug reachability: Reaching this bug requires that you can createshmem/file THP mappings - anonymous THP uses different code that doesn'tzap stuff under rmap locks.  File THP is gated on an experimental configflag (CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS), so on normal distro kernels you needshmem THP to hit this bug.  As far as I know, getting shmem THP normallyrequires that you can mount your own tmpfs with the right mount flags,which would require creating your own user+mount namespace; though I don'tknow if some distros maybe enable shmem THP by default or something likethat.Bug impact: This issue can likely be used for user->kernel privilegeescalation when it is reachable.Publication Date: Wed Oct 23 09:00:49 2024#CVE #Vulnerability",

Prior to Sep 27, 2024, if a user generated a terminal command via Cursor's Terminal Cmd-K/Ctrl-K feature and if the user explicitly imported a malicious web page into the Terminal Cmd-K prompt, an attacker with control over the referenced web page could have a significant chance of influencing a language model to output arbitrary commands for execution in the user's terminal. This scenario would require the user explicitly opt-in to including the contents of a compromised webpage, and it would require that the attacker display prompt injection text in the the contents of the compromised webpage.A server-side patch to not stream back newlines or control characters was released on September 27, 2024, within two hours of the issue being reported. Additionally, Cursor 0.42 includes client-side mitigations to prevent any newline or control character from being streamed into the terminal directly. It also contains a new setting, `\"cursor.terminal.usePreviewBox\"`, which, if set to true, streams the response into a preview box whose contents then have to be manually accepted before being inserted into the terminal. This setting is useful if you're working in a shell environment where commands can be executed without pressing enter or any control character. The patch has been applied server-side, so no additional action is needed, even on older versions of Cursor. Separately, Cursor's maintainers also recommend, as best practice, to only include trusted pieces of context in prompts.Publication Date: Wed Oct 23 01:11:47 2024#CVE #Vulnerability",
