One solution is to use an API, but I need to carve out some time to set that up. For now, the posts I don’t share on the website or social media will just have a non-clickable description, but subscribers will still get the link to see the full post.",

After not being able to locate the issue, a workaround is in place to restart the server every 2 days via cron and a script is run to shrink the database that the server uses to store information. I confirmed no further intervention is needed by me to do this, therefore monitoring the automation of this is all that is needed.\n\n🐛 Open Bugs:\n* [Minor]: When changing all images to have rounded corners it makes the images look stretched and not centered on the website/X/Telegram/LinkedIn.\n* [Minor]: X image previews on links are not center for the Feature image.\n* [Minor]: Add new tags next to new urls is not showing properly against the table.\n* [Minor]: Feature image on posts no longer zooms in/out after fixing previous image issues not zooming in and out properly specifically on posts. Workaround is to look down the post to see that initial image which can zoom in and out.",

This includes 25 new monitored links. The platform is now actively monitoring 400+ links in real time. As of this post, currently 362 are up, 25 are down, and 17 are paused.\n* Removed 2 sites that no longer exist\n* Updated 1 Hosting Onion to new URL\n\n🐛 Bug Fixes:\n* [Minor]: X image previews on links were rarely center. This issue is greatly improved moving forward.\n\n🐛 Open Bugs:\n* [Minor]: When changing all images to have rounded corners it makes the images look stretched and not centered on the website/X/Telegram/LinkedIn.\n* [Minor]: Add new tags next to new urls is not showing properly against the table.\n* [Minor]: Feature image on posts no longer zooms in/out after fixing previous image issues not zooming in and out properly specifically on posts. Workaround is to look down the post to see that initial image which can zoom in and out.",
