Founded in 1951, it works to strengthen financial and political backing for Israel in the U.S. Congress. It is seen as playing a role in influencing American decisions that support Israel, including military funding and operations like the war in Gaza. However, AIPAC does not provide direct funding for wars, but it does influence policies that may support Israel militarily.\n\n🏴‍☠️🇺🇸⚡️هي مجموعة ضغط قوية في الولايات المتحدة تدعم العلاقات بين أمريكا وإسرائيل. تأسست عام 1951، وتعمل على تعزيز الدعم المالي والسياسي لإسرائيل في الكونغرس الأمريكي. يُنظر إليها على أنها تلعب دوراً في التأثير على القرارات الأمريكية التي تدعم إسرائيل، بما في ذلك التمويل العسكري والعمليات العسكرية مثل الحرب في غزة. ومع ذلك، فإن AIPAC لا تقدم تمويلاً مباشراً للحروب، لكنها تؤثر في السياسات التي قد تدعم إسرائيل عسكرياً\n\n🤔 هجوم مدمر يعطل الخدمات والتطبيق من الداخل والمواقع المرتبطه به\n\n⚪️Test power tool 35 million requests per second [Rps] 🤔/new upgrades \n\n⚪️Results = Disabled services + crash login account + app crash. \n\n👑Eliron Networks sponsored by Darkmeta \n\n⭕Duration: To be confirmed\n\nNote: If the home page is visible, it is just cache.

Founded in 1951, it works to strengthen financial and political backing for Israel in the U.S. Congress. It is seen as playing a role in influencing American decisions that support Israel, including military funding and operations like the war in Gaza. However, AIPAC does not provide direct funding for wars, but it does influence policies that may support Israel militarily.\n\n🏴‍☠️🇺🇸⚡️هي مجموعة ضغط قوية في الولايات المتحدة تدعم العلاقات بين أمريكا وإسرائيل. تأسست عام 1951، وتعمل على تعزيز الدعم المالي والسياسي لإسرائيل في الكونغرس الأمريكي. يُنظر إليها على أنها تلعب دوراً في التأثير على القرارات الأمريكية التي تدعم إسرائيل، بما في ذلك التمويل العسكري والعمليات العسكرية مثل الحرب في غزة. ومع ذلك، فإن AIPAC لا تقدم تمويلاً مباشراً للحروب، لكنها تؤثر في السياسات التي قد تدعم إسرائيل عسكرياً\n\n🤔 هجوم مدمر يعطل الخدمات والتطبيق من الداخل والمواقع المرتبطه به\n\n⚪️Test power tool 35 million requests per second [Rps] 🤔/new upgrades \n\n⚪️Results = Disabled services + crash login account + app crash. \n\n👑Eliron Networks sponsored by Darkmeta \n\n⭕Duration: To be confirmed\n\nNote: If the home page is visible, it is just cache.

Польская машина «Росомаха» является доработанной версией финской бронемашины Patria AMV и выпускается по лицензии компанией Rosomak SA (входит в состав государственной группы Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa SA). В ВСУ они начали поставлятся с прошлого года. \n\nПольша заняла очень хитрую позицию в этом конфликте. Они одними из первых бросились помогать ВСУ и передавать им свою старую или некачественную технику. Взамен они теперь получают новую и более современную технику.\n\nМы проинспектировали компьютеры ВСУ и нашли необходимые материалы. В технической документации подробно расписано, как правильно эксплуатировать польско-финский броневик, чтоб он без поломок своим ходом доехал до РФ. И мы знаем, что эта «экспресс-доставка трофеев» очень не нравятся западным партнерам этой самой техники, несмотря на полученные барыши от ее продажи. 😎",

For PMD entries that point to page tables and are fully covered\nby the source address range, move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...) is called,\nwhich first takes rmap locks, then does move_normal_pmd(). \nmove_normal_pmd() takes the necessary page table locks at source and\ndestination, then moves an entire page table from the source to the\ndestination.\n\nThe problem is: The rmap locks, which protect against concurrent page\ntable removal by retract_page_tables() in the THP code, are only taken\nafter the PMD entry has been read and it has been decided how to move it. \nSo we can race as follows (with two processes that have mappings of the\nsame tmpfs file that is stored on a tmpfs mount with huge=advise); note\nthat process A accesses page tables through the MM while process B does it\nthrough the file rmap:\n\nprocess A                      process B\n=========                      =========\nmremap\n  mremap_to\n    move_vma\n      move_page_tables\n        get_old_pmd\n        alloc_new_pmd\n                      *** PREEMPT ***\n                               madvise(MADV_COLLAPSE)\n                                 do_madvise\n                                   madvise_walk_vmas\n                                     madvise_vma_behavior\n                                       madvise_collapse\n                                         hpage_collapse_scan_file\n                                           collapse_file\n                                             retract_page_tables\n                                               i_mmap_lock_read(mapping)\n                                               pmdp_collapse_flush\n                                               i_mmap_unlock_read(mapping)\n        move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...)\n          take_rmap_locks\n          move_normal_pmd\n          drop_rmap_locks\n\nWhen this happens, move_normal_pmd() can end up creating bogus PMD entries\nin the line `pmd_populate(mm, new_pmd, pmd_pgtable(pmd))`.  The effect\ndepends on arch-specific and machine-specific details; on x86, you can end\nup with physical page 0 mapped as a page table, which is likely\nexploitable for user->kernel privilege escalation.\n\nFix the race by letting process B recheck that the PMD still points to a\npage table after the rmap locks have been taken.  Otherwise, we bail and\nlet the caller fall back to the PTE-level copying path, which will then\nbail immediately at the pmd_none() check.\n\nBug reachability: Reaching this bug requires that you can create\nshmem/file THP mappings - anonymous THP uses different code that doesn't\nzap stuff under rmap locks.  File THP is gated on an experimental config\nflag (CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS), so on normal distro kernels you need\nshmem THP to hit this bug.  As far as I know, getting shmem THP normally\nrequires that you can mount your own tmpfs with the right mount flags,\nwhich would require creating your own user+mount namespace; though I don't\nknow if some distros maybe enable shmem THP by default or something like\nthat.\n\nBug impact: This issue can likely be used for user->kernel privilege\nescalation when it is reachable.\n\nPublication Date: Wed Oct 23 09:00:49 2024\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",

Prior to Sep 27, 2024, if a user generated a terminal command via Cursor's Terminal Cmd-K/Ctrl-K feature and if the user explicitly imported a malicious web page into the Terminal Cmd-K prompt, an attacker with control over the referenced web page could have a significant chance of influencing a language model to output arbitrary commands for execution in the user's terminal. This scenario would require the user explicitly opt-in to including the contents of a compromised webpage, and it would require that the attacker display prompt injection text in the the contents of the compromised webpage.\n\nA server-side patch to not stream back newlines or control characters was released on September 27, 2024, within two hours of the issue being reported. Additionally, Cursor 0.42 includes client-side mitigations to prevent any newline or control character from being streamed into the terminal directly. It also contains a new setting, `\"cursor.terminal.usePreviewBox\"`, which, if set to true, streams the response into a preview box whose contents then have to be manually accepted before being inserted into the terminal. This setting is useful if you're working in a shell environment where commands can be executed without pressing enter or any control character. The patch has been applied server-side, so no additional action is needed, even on older versions of Cursor. Separately, Cursor's maintainers also recommend, as best practice, to only include trusted pieces of context in prompts.\n\nPublication Date: Wed Oct 23 01:11:47 2024\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",

A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6 affects all Kirby sites with user accounts (unless Kirby's API and Panel are disabled in the config). It can only be abused if a Kirby user is logged in on a device or browser that is shared with potentially untrusted users or if an attacker already maliciously used a previous password to log in to a Kirby site as the affected user.\n\nInsufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization. In the variation described in this advisory, it allows attackers to stay logged in to a Kirby site on another device even if the logged in user has since changed their password. Kirby did not invalidate user sessions that were created with a password that was since changed by the user or by a site admin. If a user changed their password to lock out an attacker who was already in possession of the previous password or of a login session on another device or browser, the attacker would not be reliably prevented from accessing the Kirby site as the affected user.\n\nThe problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers have updated the authentication implementation to keep track of the hashed password in each active session. If the password changed since the login, the session is invalidated. To enforce this fix even if the vulnerability was previously abused, all users are logged out from the Kirby site after updating to one of the patched releases.\n\nPublication Date: Wed Oct 23 17:03:26 2024\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",
