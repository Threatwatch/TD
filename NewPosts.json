            "post_title": "💡Questions I've been asked regarding making all the Onions on the platform public. Excuse any spelling/grammar issues. This is a little long, sorry.\n\n1. Will there be a p*rnographic category?\nA. No. If you want p*rn, there is plenty of free content available on the Clearnet.\n\n2. Will there be a doxxing category?\nA. No. Everyone knows where to go for that.\n\n3. How do you control linking to possible CSAM?\nA. This primarily applies to onion search engines or onion indexes. When you see this category, it doesn’t have many links. I routinely review these links for such content.\n\n4. Will there be a way to report possible links to CSAM or other prohibited content? What about submitting new links?\nA. Yes, there will be a way to submit proof without providing any personal identity, like an email, to me. If a reported link is down at the time of review, it will be declined. If you want to submit a new link, there will be a simple process for doing so. All links are manually verified.\n\n5. What is considered \"banned\" from your website?\nA. The following are prohibited: b*stiality, CSAM, g*re, p*rn, r*pe, red rooms (they’re all fake), scam sites, t*rture, weapon-buying onion sites, and things like any of these.\n\n6. How many links are on the platform?\nA. There are 413 links as of this post. Of these, 261 are onion links, while the rest are Clearnet links. These are categorized in the subscribers' area, where you can view a page with all categories, just not the content if you arent a current paid subscriber (https://darkwebinformer.com/tag/subscribers/).\n\n7. Why are you changing from paid access to free access for these links?\nA. Many people get scammed daily by websites that appear professional, but carry phishing links. The platform receives significant traffic, so making legitimate links freely available helps protect users. Also, most of the traffic on this platform from paid subscribers comes from  the blog posts that are made daily and not the subscribers area that contains the Onions. I've reviewed the traffic to confirm this.\n\n8. Will there be ads like I see on other sites?\nA. No. The only ad you’ll see is from legitimate companies, like WhiteIntel, that have paid for a spot on the platform. If I openly accepted ads for markets or similar content, it would attract unwanted attention from law enforcement. If you are a registered company and want your ad displayed, feel free to reach out.\n\n9. Will there be any referral links?\nA. No. Links will be placed within a stylized card with no referral links. You can hover over the link or copy and paste it elsewhere for verification. See the 1st screenshot for an early example.\n\n10. How do you check for new links or updates, specifically for onions?\nA. I have multiple methods for tracking updates, including monitoring ransomware groups, newly discovered links, Darknet Market updates, and new markets. Among other things.\n\n11. How does the status page work?\nA. The status page displays the status of every link being tracked on the platform. The status bar shows the last hour's activity, and the uptime percentage reflects the past 24 hours. Updates occur every 5 minutes and there is no need to refresh the page. There are roughly 800-1,100 alerts daily based on Telegram notifications. If you want access to this Telegram channel, I will make it public, but keep in mind that updates happen in real-time and you will get many alerts if notifications are not muted. You will not receive notifications on the status page when something is up or down. See the 2nd screenshot as an example to the status page.\n\n12. How can I help?\nA. You can donate or subscribe to the platform. This is a full-time job, and despite what many may think, it’s my source of income.",

Once they enter their details, such as Gmail credentials, they are prompted to change their account password on the website. When this happens, the hacker removes the victim’s phone reset option and unlinks all of their devices.\n\nMethod 2 (Game Selling):\n • Selling gaming accounts, such as for MLBB (Mobile Legends: Bang Bang) and Free Fire. The seller offers the account, and the buyer (who is actually the hacker) asks for Gmail login access under the pretense of verifying that the seller isn’t a scammer. Once the buyer (hacker) gains access to the account, they reset the victim’s phone via Gmail, change the password, and unlink all details and devices.\n\nWhat Happens After They Gain Gmail Access?\n • The hackers will message the victim and blackmail them. If the victim doesn’t pay the demanded amount, the hackers threaten to sell sensitive information like work data or confidential files stored in the email.\n\nWhy Do They Reset the Victim’s Phone?\n • This prevents the victim from verifying their devices to regain access or ensures the victim is completely locked out of their accounts.\n\nFOllow For More Updates 💡 :\n@RipperSec | @RipperSecIO | @RipperSecGroup | @PyRoxyForum",

The victim alleges that we attacked them by hacking their phone, camera, computer, and Wi-Fi.\n\nAs we all know, we only target individuals or entities with justified reasons, and every operation we carry out is carefully investigated and discussed for its impact beforehand.\n\nThe victim in this case is a journalist who claims that we have been targeting them since the COVID-19 pandemic. They also allege that we are affiliated with a hacker group named Anonymous.\n\nThe question is: if this were truly us, why would we target a journalist we have not known for over six years? Moreover, RipperSec was only established in 2023.\n\nThe purpose of this notice is to refute the allegations made against us.\n\nTo the victim, please conduct proper investigations before spreading false information.

Reuters reported that the National Assembly, with 190 out of 300 lawmakers present, passed a resolution to annul President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law order.\n\nNational Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik announced that President Yoon's martial law order was invalid.\n\nAccording to the South Korean Constitution, martial law must be lifted immediately upon the majority request of the National Assembly.",

Previous arrests also have shown assets seized (cryptocurrency), and restitution.\n\nAlthough, the restitution part would be difficult because prison pay in the United States (varying) is approx. $1.41/hour (some as low as $0.03/hr) and some ransomware affiliates owe millions in restitution to victims. This means, ideally, a high paid prisoner would have to work 709,000 hours (29,550 days, 80 years) to pay victims back if they owed $1,000,000 in restitution.\n\ntl;dr if caught doing ransomware, the United States government will take your money, ban you from electronics, sentence you to 20 years in prison, and may you pay back millions at a rate of $1/hr\n\ntl;dr tl;dr if caught doing ransomware, your life is ruined forever (or about 30% of your adult life, depending on how long you live, or unless you \"unalive\" yourself in prison)",

We have been dumping them into a giant pool. We have received feedback from users regarding their dissatisfaction with this decision. Hence, we are re-organizing the Windows malware paper collection and introducing new sections to make navigation easier.\n\nNew sections:\n- AMSI\n- Evasion\n- GPU Abuse\n- Hooking\n- Infection\n- Initial Access\n- Internals and Analysis\n- Kernel Mode\n- Keylogging\n- LSASS\n- Networking\n- Persistence\n- Process Injection\n- Shellcode Execution\n- Syscalls\n- System Components and Abuse\n- Windows COM\n\n2. We have begun processing our massive backlog of malware samples. Our current backlog dates back to November, 29th. The current ingestion estimate is 600,000 new malwares.\n\n3. As many have you seen — we have made a pseudo-pseudo-fork of vx-underground. We now have an entire 'side project' dedicated to collecting images of cats. We have received and reviewed your feedback — all images received will be pHashed (perpetually hashed?) to ensure no duplicate photos of cats exist. We have purchased a domain for the side project, we are actively developing something to display and distribute photos of cats. The current cats-related Twitter profiles do not suffice. They fail to categorize them in a structured database and do not actively distribute the cat image data to their userbase. It is disgusting and we hate it.\n\nThis is only partially a joke. But, we're wondering if we can use our nerd-mindset to defeat large cat-centric social media profiles.\n\n4. Beside the stupid idea of collecting cat photos, we are returning to business as usual. All giveaways are done, poop posting will be minimal(ish)(depends on mood), our focus will be shifted back to malware-related material aggregation and being cybercrime TMZ.\n\nThanks,\n- smelly smellington",

Our friends over at Binary_Defense and TrustedSec have helped us out tremendously lately. We'd especially like to thank HackingDave for helping the little nerds out and keeping malware cool and badass (and free) forever and ever. We'll be listing them on the website later.\n\nNext up: we're working with our friends at TorGuard VPN to expand our infrastructure. They have a lot (and quite honestly, a disturbing) amount of computational resources. We will be working with them for 2 things.\n\n1. Wide spread cat picture aggregation.\n2. Wide spread malware ingestion\n\nNext, next, on the other side of the autism spectrum: our in-house software engineer guessthepw is working on constructing a kitty cat photo database. All cats ingested will be available to browse, download, whatever.\n\nPeople have asked: \"smelly smellington, what's your end game with these cats?\". The answer is very shrimple: no idea, thought of it while using the restroom. \n\nLet's see where this whacky adventure takes us. Maybe in a few years it'll be bigger than vx-underground and we can use it to fuel our malware addiction. Or, alternatively, nothing will happen and the project will be dead in a year. Let's see what happens! Sometimes in life you gotta do just a thing, see if it fails, or succeeds, or what happens.\n\nWe've got lots of work to do in 2025.\n\nFinally, as is tradition, we've got more malware to add, more malware papers to add, lots and lots of stuff. Very cool.\n\nThanks,\n- smelly smellington",

Understandably, that seems kind of obvious, it's in the name — 'malicious software'. But it seems less obvious to some that, in order to write malware, you apply the exact same principles, techniques, and structures that legitimate software uses.\n\nMalware is regular ol' programming with some sprinkles of weird stuff. These weird things are documented and shared. Some try to find new weird things.\n\nWhen people ask what language is best for malware... it's kind of like asking 'what's the best ice cream flavor?'. It's entirely subjective. Everyone will tell you something different. You'll notice a lot of people will prefer Chocolate or Vanilla, you may encounter some who like Raspberry Banana Sprinkle Jam-Blam Blast, or Minty Schminty SpongeBob Sticks Bombs, but at the end of the day it's all still ice cream.\n\nIn it's most simple form, all malware techniques are things legitimate software may do.\n\nRansomware?\n- Step 1. Enumerate files in a directory\n- Step 2. Lock and encrypt files\n\nInformation Stealers?\n- Step 1. Enumerate files in a directory\n- Step 2. Upload files somewhere\n\nRATs?\n- Step 1. Make program run at start\n- Step 2. Execute commands (cmd, powershell, other programs)\n- Step 3. Upload files somewhere\n\nLoaders?\n- Step 1. Download file from somewhere\n- Step 2. Run file\n\nEverything the malware does is just an expansion of what is explained above.\n\nWant to find new malware techniques? Find new ways to execute a process, find new ways to enumerate files in a directory, file new ways to upload files somewhere, find new ways to download files from somewhere, find new ways to write to files or delete files, etc.\n\nHow do you do this? Read. Read everything. Blogs, Windows documentation, StackOverflow, Wikipedia, our website. Look at every DLL you find on your computer in Ida or Ghidra, just open stuff and look around. Look at other peoples work and see if you can expand on it and find something new.\n\ntl;dr learn to code, then learn weird stuff",

There is a possible Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability  in the `content_security_policy` helper starting in version 5.2.0 of Action Pack and prior to versions 7.0.8.7, 7.1.5.1, 7.2.2.1, and 8.0.0.1. Applications which set Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers dynamically from untrusted user input may be vulnerable to carefully crafted inputs being able to inject new directives into the CSP. This could lead to a bypass of the CSP and its protection against XSS and other attacks. Versions 7.0.8.7, 7.1.5.1, 7.2.2.1, and 8.0.0.1 contain a fix. As a workaround, applications can avoid setting CSP headers dynamically from untrusted input, or can validate/sanitize that input.\n\nPublication Date: Wed Dec 11 03:04:03 2024\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",

Versions of sigstore-python newer than 2.0.0 but prior to 3.6.0 perform insufficient validation of the \"integration time\" present in \"v2\" and \"v3\" bundles during the verification flow: the \"integration time\" is verified *if* a source of signed time (such as an inclusion promise) is present, but is otherwise trusted if no source of signed time is present. This does not affect \"v1\" bundles, as the \"v1\" bundle format always requires an inclusion promise.\n\nSigstore uses signed time to support verification of signatures made against short-lived signing keys. The impact and severity of this weakness is *low*, as Sigstore contains multiple other enforcing components that prevent an attacker who modifies the integration timestamp within a bundle from impersonating a valid signature. In particular, an attacker who modifies the integration timestamp can induce a Denial of Service, but in no different manner than already possible with bundle access (e.g. modifying the signature itself such that it fails to verify). Separately, an attacker could upload a *new* entry to the transparency service, and substitute their new entry's time. However, this would still be rejected at validation time, as the new entry's (valid) signed time would be outside the validity window of the original signing certificate and would nonetheless render the attacker auditable.\n\nPublication Date: Wed Dec 11 03:03:41 2024\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",

            "post_title": "Vulnerability ID: CVE-2024-53096\n\nDescription: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: resolve faulty mmap_region() error path behaviour\n\nThe mmap_region() function is somewhat terrifying, with spaghetti-like\ncontrol flow and numerous means by which issues can arise and incomplete\nstate, memory leaks and other unpleasantness can occur.\n\nA large amount of the complexity arises from trying to handle errors late\nin the process of mapping a VMA, which forms the basis of recently\nobserved issues with resource leaks and observable inconsistent state.\n\nTaking advantage of previous patches in this series we move a number of\nchecks earlier in the code, simplifying things by moving the core of the\nlogic into a static internal function __mmap_region().\n\nDoing this allows us to perform a number of checks up front before we do\nany real work, and allows us to unwind the writable unmap check\nunconditionally as required and to perform a CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_MAPLE_TREE\nvalidation unconditionally also.\n\nWe move a number of things here:\n\n1. We preallocate memory for the iterator before we call the file-backed\n   memory hook, allowing us to exit early and avoid having to perform\n   complicated and error-prone close/free logic. We carefully free\n   iterator state on both success and error paths.\n\n2. The enclosing mmap_region() function handles the mapping_map_writable()\n   logic early. Previously the logic had the mapping_map_writable() at the\n   point of mapping a newly allocated file-backed VMA, and a matching\n   mapping_unmap_writable() on success and error paths.\n\n   We now do this unconditionally if this is a file-backed, shared writable\n   mapping. If a driver changes the flags to eliminate VM_MAYWRITE, however\n   doing so does not invalidate the seal check we just performed, and we in\n   any case always decrement the counter in the wrapper.\n\n   We perform a debug assert to ensure a driver does not attempt to do the\n   opposite.\n\n3. We also move arch_validate_flags() up into the mmap_region()\n   function. This is only relevant on arm64 and sparc64, and the check is\n   only meaningful for SPARC with ADI enabled. We explicitly add a warning\n   for this arch if a driver invalidates this check, though the code ought\n   eventually to be fixed to eliminate the need for this.\n\nWith all of these measures in place, we no longer need to explicitly close\nthe VMA on error paths, as we place all checks which might fail prior to a\ncall to any driver mmap hook.\n\nThis eliminates an entire class of errors, makes the code easier to reason\nabout and more robust.\n\nReferance: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53096\n\nDate of Publishing: 2024/12/24\n\nLink to Exploit: https://project-zero.issues.chromium.org/issues/374117290\n\n#CVE #vulnerability #exploit",

Prior to version 1.4.3, an attacker can write a malicious expression that escapes the sandbox to execute arbitrary code on the system. With a more complex (undisclosed) payload, one can get full access to Arbitrary code execution on the system. The problem has been patched in version 1.4.3 of Angular Expressions. Two possible workarounds are available. One may either disable access to `__proto__` globally or make sure that one uses the function with just one argument.\n\nReferance: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-54152\n\nDate of Publishing: 2024/12/30\n\nLink to Exploit: https://github.com/math-x-io/CVE-2024-54152-poc\n\n#CVE #vulnerability #exploit",

Starting no later than version 3.2.10 and prior to version 4.0.2, an attacker can inject malicious HTML content into the FAQ editor at `http[:]//localhost/admin/index[.]php?action=editentry`, resulting in a complete disruption of the FAQ page's user interface. By injecting malformed HTML elements styled to cover the entire screen, an attacker can render the page unusable. This injection manipulates the page structure by introducing overlapping buttons, images, and iframes, breaking the intended layout and functionality. Exploiting this issue can lead to Denial of Service for legitimate users, damage to the user experience, and potential abuse in phishing or defacement attacks. Version 4.0.2 contains a patch for the vulnerability.\n\nPublication Date: Thu Jan 02 21:12:56 2025\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",

Version 0.22.0 of memos removes the vulnerable file.\n\nReferance: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29029\n\nDate of Publishing: 2025/01/02\n\nLink to Exploit: https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-154_GHSL-2023-156_memos/\n\n#CVE #vulnerability #exploit",

Prior to version 1.7.46, a low privilege user account with page edit privilege can read any server files using Twig Syntax. This includes Grav user account files - `/grav/user/accounts/*.yaml`. This file stores hashed user password, 2FA secret, and the password reset token. This can allow an adversary to compromise any registered account and read any file in the web server by resetting a password for a user to get access to the password reset token from the file or by cracking the hashed password. A low privileged user may also perform a full account takeover of other registered users including Administrators.

This vulnerability allows\nattackers to exploit the deserialization process by sending specially crafted malicious serialized data,\npotentially leading to remote code execution (RCE) attacks.\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n    \n\n\n   \n\n\n  \n\n\n \nThis issue affects MINA core versions 2.0.X, 2.1.X and 2.2.X, and will be fixed by the releases 2.0.27, 2.1.10 and 2.2.4.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also important to note that an application using MINA core library will only be affected if the IoBuffer#getObject() method is called, and this specific method is potentially called when adding a ProtocolCodecFilter instance using the ObjectSerializationCodecFactory class in the filter chain. If your application is specifically using those classes, you have to upgrade to the latest version of MINA core library.\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading will  not be enough: you also need to explicitly allow the classes the decoder will accept in the ObjectSerializationDecoder instance, using one of the three new methods:\n\n\n\n\n    /**\n\n     * Accept class names where the supplied ClassNameMatcher matches for\n\n     * deserialization, unless they are otherwise rejected.\n\n     *\n\n     * @param classNameMatcher the matcher to use\n\n     */\n\n    public void accept(ClassNameMatcher classNameMatcher)\n\n\n\n\n    /**\n\n     * Accept class names that match the supplied pattern for\n\n     * deserialization, unless they are otherwise rejected.\n\n     *\n\n     * @param pattern standard Java regexp\n\n     */\n\n    public void accept(Pattern pattern) \n\n\n\n\n\n    /**\n\n     * Accept the wildcard specified classes for deserialization,\n\n     * unless they are otherwise rejected.\n\n     *\n\n     * @param patterns Wildcard file name patterns as defined by\n\n     *                  {@link org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils#wildcardMatch(String, String) FilenameUtils.wildcardMatch}\n\n     */\n\n    public void accept(String... patterns)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the decoder will reject *all* classes that will be present in the incoming data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The FtpServer, SSHd and Vysper sub-project are not affected by this issue.\n\nPublication Date: Fri Jan 03 16:09:47 2025\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",

GoCD versions prior to 24.5.0 are vulnerable to admin privilege escalation due to improper authorization of access to the admin \"Configuration XML\" UI feature, and its associated API. A malicious insider/existing authenticated GoCD user with an existing GoCD user account could abuse this vulnerability to access information intended only for GoCD admins, or to escalate their privileges to that of a GoCD admin in a persistent manner. it is not possible for this vulnerability to be abused prior to authentication/login. The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.5.0. GoCD users who are not able to immediate upgrade can mitigate this issue by using a reverse proxy, WAF or similar to externally block access paths with a `/go/rails/` prefix. Blocking this route causes no loss of functionality. If it is not possible to upgrade or block the above route, consider reducing the GoCD user base to more trusted set of users, including temporarily disabling use of plugins such as the guest-login-plugin, which allow limited anonymous access as a regular user account.\n\nPublication Date: Fri Jan 03 19:07:31 2025\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",

GoCD versions 18.9.0 through 24.4.0 (inclusive) can allow GoCD admins to abuse the backup configuration \"post-backup script\" feature to potentially execute arbitrary scripts on the hosting server or container as GoCD's user, rather than pre-configured scripts. In practice the impact of this vulnerability is limited, as in most configurations a user who can log into the GoCD UI as an admin also has host administration permissions for the host/container that GoCD runs on, in order to manage artifact storage and other service-level configuration options. Additionally, since a GoCD admin has ability to configure and schedule pipelines tasks on all GoCD agents available to the server, the fundamental functionality of GoCD allows co-ordinated task execution similar to that of post-backup-scripts. However in restricted environments where the host administration is separated from the role of a GoCD admin, this may be unexpected. The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.5.0. Post-backup scripts can no longer be executed from within certain sensitive locations on the GoCD server. No known workarounds are available.\n\nPublication Date: Fri Jan 03 20:07:20 2025\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",

GoCD versions 16.7.0 through 24.4.0 (inclusive) can allow GoCD admins to abuse a hidden/unused configuration repository (pipelines as code) feature to allow XML External Entity (XXE) injection on the GoCD Server which will be executed when GoCD periodically scans configuration repositories for pipeline updates, or is triggered by an administrator or config repo admin. In practice the impact of this vulnerability is limited, in most cases without combining with another vulnerability, as only GoCD (super) admins have the ability to abuse this vulnerability. Typically a malicious GoCD admin can cause much larger damage than that they can do with XXE injection. The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.5.0.

This issue is fixed in GoCD 24.5.0. Some workarounds are available. One may temporarily block access to  `/go/*/pipelines/snippet` routes from an external reverse proxy or WAF if one's \"group admin\" users do not need the functionality to edit the XML of pipelines directly (rather than using the UI, or using a configuration repository).

Prior to version 1.12.0, both in karmadactl and karmada-operator, it is possible to supply a filesystem path, or an HTTP(s) URL to retrieve the custom resource definitions(CRDs) needed by Karmada. The CRDs are downloaded as a gzipped tarfile and are vulnerable to a TarSlip vulnerability. An attacker able to supply a malicious CRD file into a Karmada initialization could write arbitrary files in arbitrary paths of the filesystem. From Karmada version 1.12.0, when processing custom CRDs files, CRDs archive verification is utilized to enhance file system robustness. A workaround is available. Someone who needs to set flag `--crd` to customize the CRD files required for Karmada initialization when using `karmadactl init` to set up Karmada can manually inspect the CRD files to check whether they contain sequences such as `../` that would alter file paths, to determine if they potentially include malicious files. When using karmada-operator to set up Karmada, one must upgrade one's karmada-operator to one of the fixed versions.\n\nPublication Date: Fri Jan 03 20:06:36 2025\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",

This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\nReferance: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47822\n\nDate of Publishing: 2025/01/03\n\nLink to Exploit: https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-vw58-ph65-6rxp\n\n#CVE #vulnerability #exploit",

Prior to version 1.12.0, the PULL mode clusters registered with the `karmadactl register` command have excessive privileges to access control plane resources. By abusing these permissions, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent to a karmada cluster would be able to obtain administrative privileges over the entire federation system including all registered member clusters. Since Karmada v1.12.0, command `karmadactl register` restricts the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources. This way, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent cannot control other member clusters in Karmada. As a workaround, one may restrict the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources according to Karmada Component Permissions Docs.\n\nPublication Date: Fri Jan 03 21:03:37 2025\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",

In version 1.39.0, use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors, allowing standard input to be re-opened as a different resource resulting in permission prompt bypass. Node child_process IPC relies on the JS side to pass the raw IPC file descriptor to `op_node_ipc_pipe()`, which returns a `IpcJsonStreamResource` ID associated with the file descriptor. On closing the resource, the raw file descriptor is closed together.\n\nUse of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors. This allow standard input (fd 0) to be closed and re-opened for a different resource, which allows a silent permission prompt bypass. This is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions.\n\nThis bug is known to be exploitable. There is a working exploit that achieves arbitrary code execution by bypassing prompts from zero permissions, additionally abusing the fact that Cache API lacks filesystem permission checks. The attack can be conducted silently as stderr can also be closed, suppressing all prompt outputs.\n\nVersion 1.39.1 fixes the bug.\n\nPublication Date: Fri Jan 03 23:11:45 2025\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",

Starting in version 1.35.1 and prior to version 1.36.3, a vulnerability in Deno's Node.js compatibility runtime allows for cross-session data contamination during simultaneous asynchronous reads from Node.js streams sourced from sockets or files. The issue arises from the re-use of a global buffer (BUF) in stream_wrap.ts used as a performance optimization to limit allocations during these asynchronous read operations. This can lead to data intended for one session being received by another session, potentially resulting in data corruption and unexpected behavior. This affects all users of Deno that use the node.js compatibility layer for network communication or other streams, including packages that may require node.js libraries indirectly. Version 1.36.3 contains a patch for this issue.\n\nPublication Date: Fri Jan 03 23:11:12 2025\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",

Starting in version 13.0.0 and prior to versions 13.5.8, 14.2.21, and 15.1.2, Next.js is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack that allows attackers to construct requests that leaves requests to Server Actions hanging until the hosting provider cancels the function execution. This vulnerability can also be used as a Denial of Wallet (DoW) attack when deployed in providers billing by response times. (Note: Next.js server is idle during that time and only keeps the connection open. CPU and memory footprint are low during that time.). Deployments without any protection against long running Server Action invocations are especially vulnerable. Hosting providers like Vercel or Netlify set a default maximum duration on function execution to reduce the risk of excessive billing. This is the same issue as if the incoming HTTP request has an invalid `Content-Length` header or never closes. If the host has no other mitigations to those then this vulnerability is novel. This vulnerability affects only Next.js deployments using Server Actions. The issue was resolved in Next.js 13.5.8, 14.2.21, and 15.1.2. We recommend that users upgrade to a safe version. There are no official workarounds.\n\nPublication Date: Sat Jan 04 00:08:41 2025\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",

In version 1.39.0, use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors, allowing standard input to be re-opened as a different resource resulting in permission prompt bypass. Node child_process IPC relies on the JS side to pass the raw IPC file descriptor to `op_node_ipc_pipe()`, which returns a `IpcJsonStreamResource` ID associated with the file descriptor. On closing the resource, the raw file descriptor is closed together.\n\nUse of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors. This allow standard input (fd 0) to be closed and re-opened for a different resource, which allows a silent permission prompt bypass. This is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions.\n\nThis bug is known to be exploitable. There is a working exploit that achieves arbitrary code execution by bypassing prompts from zero permissions, additionally abusing the fact that Cache API lacks filesystem permission checks. The attack can be conducted silently as stderr can also be closed, suppressing all prompt outputs.\n\nVersion 1.39.1 fixes the bug.\n\n\nReferance: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27933\n\nDate of Publishing: 2025/01/03\n\nLink to Exploit: https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-6q4w-9x56-rmwq\n\n#CVE #vulnerability #exploit",

Starting in version 1.35.1 and prior to version 1.36.3, a vulnerability in Deno's Node.js compatibility runtime allows for cross-session data contamination during simultaneous asynchronous reads from Node.js streams sourced from sockets or files. The issue arises from the re-use of a global buffer (BUF) in stream_wrap.ts used as a performance optimization to limit allocations during these asynchronous read operations. This can lead to data intended for one session being received by another session, potentially resulting in data corruption and unexpected behavior. This affects all users of Deno that use the node.js compatibility layer for network communication or other streams, including packages that may require node.js libraries indirectly.

All hackers will operate independently, without communication, for security reasons.\n\nWe would like to invite participants from Asia, Europe, and parts of South America, where many have agreed to participate.\n\nWe appreciate the enthusiasm and interest expressed by all participants in operation Israel. However, we must address a concern regarding motivation. We wonder if you're doing this to gain followers? Or to advertise your team of hackers?\n\nWhile we recognize that each of you embodies qualities of truth, motivation, and love, it appears that there is a strong emphasis on follower engagement. We want to promote an approach where collaboration is motivated by common goals rather than popularity.\n\nWe would like to express the deeply personal nature of our struggle as Palestinians. We invite you to stand in solidarity with us, as many among us have lost family members in Gaza or the West Bank. It is crucial to recognize that we cannot afford to let violence and injustice continue unchecked.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the variety of perspectives within the community, we have noticed that some talks have become fragmented, often focused on disputes rather than unity. This ego-driven, recognition-seeking split distracts from the serious issues we face. We invite all participants to prioritize collaboration over competition, and to refrain from attention-seeking actions that should flow from compassion.\n\nWe believe there is a significant opportunity to demonstrate the collective strength we possess. It is vital that our efforts are motivated by a commitment to justice and the well-being of all, particularly the children and families affected by this genocide. We ask that you engage in this cause not for personal glory, but out of a sincere desire to advocate for what is right.\n\nAs we invite you to join us in our advocacy, we emphasize the importance of doing so with respect and integrity. Let our actions reflect our shared values and commitment to ending violence and injustice. We urge you to stand with us, not for recognition, but to affirm our shared humanity and to demonstrate that we will not allow injustices to persist unchallenged.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that inaction is, in itself, a choice. Let us choose to act for the sake of justice and humanity.\n\nTo the world, we are Operation Israel Hackers.\n\nTo Israeli hackers, we are the children of Gaza.",

The 2024 Telecom attacks\n\nA Chinese state-sponsored hacking group known as \"Salt Typhoon\" is linked to a series of cyberattacks targeting telecommunications firms globally.\n\nThese breaches compromised at least nine major telecom providers, including AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile.\n\nThe group reportedly focused on infiltrating telecom infrastructure to steal text messages, phone call information, and voicemails from targeted people. The threat actors also targeted the wiretapping platforms used by the US government, raising serious national security concerns. \n\nA White House briefing revealed that Salt Typhoon's operations also impacted telecommunications providers in dozens of countries.\n\nIn the US, these attacks prompted concerns about weaknesses in telecom infrastructure and the security of government surveillance platforms. \n\nUS lawmakers, including Senator Ron Wyden, have proposed legislation to address vulnerabilities in the nation's telecom infrastructure. The proposed bill aims to establish stricter cybersecurity standards and oversight for telecom providers to prevent similar attacks in the future.\n\nThe US government reportedly plans to ban China Telecom's last active US operations in response toh the telecom hacks.\n\n1.

The UnitedHealth Change HealthCare ransomware attack\n\nIn February, UnitedHealth subsidiary Change Healthcare suffered a massive ransomware attack that caused massive disruption to the US healthcare industry.\n\nThe outages prevented doctors and pharmacies from filing claims and prevented pharmacies from accepting discount prescription cards, causing patients to pay full price for medications.\n\nThe attack was ultimately linked to the BlackCat ransomware gang, aka ALPHV, who used stolen credentials to breach the company's Citrix remote access service, which did not have multi-factor authentication enabled\n\nDuring the attack, the threat actors stole 6 TB of data and ultimately encrypted computers on the network, causing the company to shut down IT systems to prevent the spread of the attack.\n\nThe UnitedHealth Group admitted to paying a ransom demand to receive a decryptor and for the threat actors to delete the stolen data. The ransom payment was allegedly $22 million, according to the BlackCat ransomware affiliate who conducted the attack.\n\nThe BlackCat ransomware operation was under immense pressure from law enforcement after the Change Healthcare attacks, causing them to shut down.\n\nAfter UnitedHealth paid an alleged $20 million ransom, the ransomware operation performed an exit scam, stealing all of the money and not sharing any with the affiliate who conducted the attack.\n\nUnfortunately, the affiliate claimed to still have Change Healthcare's data, which they used to extort the healthcare company again, this time using RansomHub's extortion site.\n\nUltimately, the data disappeared from the extortion, likely indicating that another ransom was paid.\n\nIn October, UnitedHealth confirmed that over 100 million people had their personal and healthcare data stolen, marking this as the largest healthcare data breach in recent years.\n\n4. LockBit disrupted\n\nOn February 19, authorities took down LockBit's infrastructure, which included 34 servers hosting the data leak website and its mirrors, data stolen from the victims, cryptocurrency addresses, decryption keys, and the affiliate panel.\n\nThis disruption was part of an international law enforcement operation called Operation Cronos.\n\nLaw enforcement seizure message on LockBit's servers. Five days later, LockBit relaunched with new infrastructure and threatened to focus more of its attacks on the government sector.\n\nHowever, the ransomware gang was never able to return to its previous prominence, with its affiliates moving to other ransomware operations.\n\nOver the past year, law enforcement has continued to target LockBit, identifying and charging seven LockBit ransomware members.\n\nAmong those charged, is the primary operator of the ransomware operation, who the Department of Justice claims is a Russian national named Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, aka 'LockBitSupp' and 'putinkrab'.\n\nLockBit recently began testing a new encryptor called LockBit 4, which does not appear to be much different than its previous version.\n\n3. Windows 11 Recall: A privacy nightmare?\n\nMicrosoft's new AI-powered Windows 11 Recall feature has sparked a lot of concern among the cybersecurity community, with many thinking that it is a massive privacy risk and a new attack vector that threat actors can exploit to steal data.\n\nAfter receiving tremendous backlash, Microsoft delayed the release of the software to increase its security by requiring users to opt-in to enable Recall on their computers and that they'll have to confirm they're in front of their PC via Windows Hello to be able to use it.\n\nMicrosoft continued to delay its release while adding additional features, such as automatically filtering sensitive content, allowing users to exclude specific apps, websites, or in-private browsing sessions, and it can be removed if needed.\n\nHowever, after releasing the software to Windows Insiders for testing, it was discovered that Windows 11 Recall did not properly filter sensitive information, like credit cards.\n\n#CyberBulletin 4",

CDK Global ransomware attacks takes down the car dealership industry\n\nCar dealership software-as-a-service provider CDK Global suffered a Black Suit ransomware attack, causing the company to shut down its systems and leaving clients unable to operate their business normally.\n\nCDK Global provides clients in the auto industry with a SaaS platform that handles all aspects of a car dealership's operation, including CRM, financing, payroll, support and service, inventory, and back-office operations.\n\nAs many of the car dealerships in the US utilize the platform, the outage led to widespread disruption, preventing dealers from tracking and ordering car parts, conducting new sales, and offering financing.\n\n7. The SnowFlake data theft attacks\n\nIn May, threat actors began selling data that they claimed was stolen from customers of the Snowflake cloud data platform.\n\nAfter the attacks were investigated, it was determined that the threat actors didn't breach Snowflake but rather used compromised credentials to log in to customer's SnowFlake accounts.\n\nThese credentials are believed to have been stolen through information-stealing malware.\n\nOnce they logged into the account, they were able to export the databases and use them to extort companies into paying a ransom for the data not to be publicly released.\n\nAT&T disclosed in July that call logs of 109 million customers were exposed during the incident and that the data was accessed from an online database on the company's Snowflake account.\n\nTicketMaster was also impacted, with the threat actors claiming to steal the data of 560 million customers.\n\nData breaches linked to these attacks, which started in April 2024, have affected hundreds of millions of individuals using the services of AT&T, Ticketmaster, Santander, Pure Storage, Advance Auto Parts, Los Angeles Unified, QuoteWizard/LendingTree, and Neiman Marcus.\n\nIn November, the US Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against two people, Connor Riley Moucka and John Erin Binns, who are accused of being behind the attacks.\n\nThe threat actors allegedly extorted $2.5 million as part of these attacks, with Wired reporting that AT&T paid $370,000 for the hackers to delete stolen call records.\n\n6.  The North Korean IT Worker scheme\n\nNorth Korean IT workers trying to get jobs in the US and other countries to perform cyberespionage and generate revenue for their country's operations.\n\nIn May, the Department of Justice charged five individuals, a US Citizen woman, a Ukrainian man, and three foreign nationals, for their involvement in helping North Korean IT works infiltrate US job markets to generate revenue for North Korea's nuclear weapons program.\n\nIn July, email security firm KnowBe4 mistakenly hired a North Korean hacker as their Principal Software Engineer, who attempted to install information-stealing malware on the network.\n\nIn August, the Justice Department arrested a Nashville man charged with helping North Korean IT workers obtain remote work at companies across the United States and operating a laptop farm they used to pose as U.S.-based individuals.\n\n#CyberBulletin 3",

Kaspersky banned in the US—software automatically replaced with UltraAV\n\nIn June, the Biden administration announced an upcoming ban of Kaspersky antivirus software, giving customers until September 29, 2024, to find alternative security software.\n\nThe ban not only involved the sale of Kaspersky software in the US, but also prevented the company from delivering antivirus and security updates to customers.\n\nA month later, Kaspersky began shutting down its operations in the US, telling BleepingComputer that the Biden administration's decisions have made operations \"no longer viable.\"\n\nKaspersky decided to sell its US customer base to Pango and emailed customers in early September that they would receive a free upgrade to the UltraAV software.\n\nHowever, the company didn't make it clear to customers that it would uninstall its software, and on September 19, Kaspersky users suddenly found their Kaspersky products removed and UltraAV force-installed on their computersù whether they wanted it or not.\n\nThis made many Kaspersky customers furious that software was installed on their devices without permission or clear notification that it would happen.\n\n11. Russian state-sponsored hackers breached Microsoft's corporate email\n\nIn January, Microsoft disclosed that Russian state-sponsored threat actors breached their corporate email servers in November 2023 to steal email from their leadership, cybersecurity, and legal teams.\n\nSome of these emails contained information about the hacking group itself, allowing the threat actors to learn what Microsoft knew about them.\n\nThe hacking group, known as Midnight Blizzard (aka Nobelium, or APT29) is believed to be a state-backed cyberespionage group tied to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).\n\nMicrosoft later disclosed that the threat actors conducted a password-spray attack that allowed access to a legacy non-production test tenant account.\n\nThis test tenant account also had access to an OAuth application with elevated privileges in Microsoft's corporate environment, allowing the hackers to steal data from corporate mailboxes.\n\nThe hackers breached Microsoft again in March 2024 using information found in the stolen emails, allowing them to steal source code repositories.\n\nIt kept getting worse, with CISA confirming in April that emails between US federal agencies and Microsoft were also stolen in the attack. These emails contained information that let the hackers gain access to some customer's systems.\n\n10.  National Public data breach exposed your Social Security Number\n\nIn August, almost 2.7 billion records of personal information for people in the United States were leaked on a hacking forum, exposing names, social security numbers, all known physical addresses, and possible aliases.\n\nThe data was stolen from National Public Data, a company that collects and sells access to personal data for use in background checks, to obtain criminal records, and for private investigators.\n\nHave I Been Pwned's Troy Hunt analyzed the breach and determined it contained 134 million unique email addresses, making this a monstrous data breach.\n\nThe threat actors behind the breach attempted to sell it for $3.5 million, but it was eventually leaked for free on a hacking forum.\n\n#CyberBulletin 2",

            "post_title": "The biggest cybersecurity and cyberattack stories of 2024 By Cyber Bulletin January 3, 2025 \n\n2024 was a big year for cybersecurity, with significant cyberattacks, data breaches, new threat groups emerging, and, of course, zero-day vulnerabilities.\n\nThe continuation of violence in Israel has become a target for hackers across the globe, as many view it as a violation of UN international humanitarian laws and international law regarding warfare. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of children, women, and the elderly, as well as bombings of hospitals, schools, universities, and journalists. Despite efforts to secure Israeli infrastructure with the help of its allies, cybersecurity measures may prove insufficient. Israeli infrastructure is likely to remain vulnerable for many years. Critics label Israel a rogue or terrorist state, and it has experienced the highest number of cyberattacks in 2024.\n\nBelow are fourteen of what  believes are the some impactful cybersecurity stories of 2024, with a summary of each. These stories are in no particular order.\n\n14. Internet Archive hacked\n\nOn October 9, the Internet Archive was hit by two different attacks at once—a data breach where the site's user data for 33 million users was stolen and a DDoS attack by an alleged pro-Palestinian group named SN_BlackMeta.\n\nWhile both attacks occurred over the same period, they were conducted by different hackers.\n\nThis source code contained additional credentials and authentication tokens, including the credentials to Internet Archive's database management system. This allowed the hacker to download the organization's user database, further source code, and modify the site.\n\nCyberattacks against Israel in 2024 will be published in the next article by Cyber Bulletin.\n\n13. Bad CrowdStrike updates crashed 8.5 million Wndows devices On July 19th, 2024, a faulty CrowdStrike Falcon update was pushed out to Windows PCs in the early morning, causing the cybersecurity software's kernel driver to crash the operating system. \n\nThis bug caused significant global disruptions, impacting approximately 8.5 million Windows systems, who now found that their devices had crashed with no easy way back into the operating system to remove the faulty update other than booting into safe mode.\n\nThe bug stemmed from a flaw in CrowdStrike's content validation process, which failed to detect a defective update. This faulty update triggered a series of system crashes, including endless reboot loops that affected both Windows devices and Windows 365 Cloud PCs.\n\nAs CrowdStrike is used by many organizations, it quickly caused widespread disruption, impacting financial firms, airlines, and hospitals worldwide, who suddenly found their Windows devices and applications unavailable.\n\nMicrosoft released a Windows repair tool to help remove the problematic CrowdStrike driver and restore affected systems. Despite this tool, many organizations faced a lengthy recovery process as each device would need to be manually fixed.\n\nCybercriminals distributed fake CrowdStrike repair tools and manuals that pushed malware, including the new Daolpu infostealer. These phishing campaigns targeted orgs attempting to recover from the outage, further delaying outages.\n\nInvestors soon filed a lawsuit against CrowdStrike, accusing it of negligence in its quality assurance processes and failing to prevent the release of the defective update.\n\nMicrosoft also announced that they would be looking into changing their kernel driver handling policies in response to the incident and encouraged antivirus vendors to limit their use of Kernel drivers to prevent these types of crashes.\n\n#CyberBulletin 1",
