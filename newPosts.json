The content was given to non-profit organization DDoSecrets (unable to tag on X due to their account being suspended) and is available for anyone to review\n\n2. Upon compromise (and exfiltration of data, presumably), the individual(s) responsible for the compromise inserted pro-transgender emojis onto the site and uploaded AI photos of Andrew Tate with a transgender flag. The compromise of Andrew Tate's website appears to be ideologically motivated, not financially motivated\n\n3. Upon review of the compromised data we spotted some inconsistencies with reporting from media outlets. Some media outlets have stated the stolen data contains over 325,000 user email addresses. However, upon review we do not see email addresses UNLESS the users actual username on the website was their email address. We only spotted a few thousand (see image 1)\n\nThe file in the leaked, \"users.json\", contains the following:\n- Unique UserID\n- Username\n- External UserID\n- Score (reputation)\n- Coin balance (forum based currency)\n- Server (unsure)\n- \"User\" (unsure)\n- Join Date\n- Roles\n\nOther fields visible, which appear to be optional entries based on users interaction with the website:\n- Profile content\n- \"Learnv2\"\n- Avatar\n\nAlso present in the compromise is chat logs from both public and private rooms. These rooms include:\n- AI Automation\n- Business Mastery\n- Content Creation & AI Campus\n- Copywriting\n- Crypto DeFi\n- Crypto Trading\n- Cryptocurrency Investing\n- ECommerce\n- Fitness\n- Hustler's Campus\n- Social Media & Client Acquisition\n- The Real World\n\nEach room described has a both public and private variant. We briefly skimmed the contents of these and can confirm they have unfathomable amounts of chat logs and conversations. In the spirit of full disclosure: we are not going to review and/or read these chat logs. They are massive. In summary: the dumped conversations are legit.\n\nAs a disclaimer: it may be possible that email addresses and more sensitive information is in the chat logs. We have not reviewed this in totality to confirm that (we don't feel like it).",

When using `--auth-mode=client`, Archived Workflows can be retrieved with a fake or spoofed token via the GET Workflow endpoint: `/api/v1/workflows/{namespace}/{name}` or when using `--auth-mode=sso`, all Archived Workflows can be retrieved with a valid token via the GET Workflow endpoint: `/api/v1/workflows/{namespace}/{name}`. No authentication is performed by the Server itself on `client` tokens. Authentication & authorization is instead delegated to the k8s API server. However, the Workflow Archive does not interact with k8s, and so any token that looks valid will be considered authenticated, even if it is not a k8s token or even if the token has no RBAC for Argo. To handle the lack of pass-through k8s authN/authZ, the Workflow Archive specifically does the equivalent of a `kubectl auth can-i` check for respective methods. In 3.5.7 and 3.5.8, the auth check was accidentally removed on the GET Workflow endpoint's fallback to archived workflows on these lines, allowing archived workflows to be retrieved with a fake token. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.6.2 and 3.5.13.\n\nPublication Date: Mon Dec 02 20:10:53 2024\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",

When parsing form data, python-multipart skips line breaks (CR \\r or LF \\n) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary. This happens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which may cause excessive logging for certain inputs. An attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.18.\n\nPublication Date: Mon Dec 02 20:10:42 2024\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",

For example,\n if the payload is `record { * ; empty }` and the canister interface expects `record { * }` then the Rust candid decoder treats empty as an extra field required by the type.  The problem with the type empty is that the candid Rust library wrongly categorizes empty as a recoverable error when skipping the field and thus causing an infinite decoding loop.\n\n\nCanisters using affected versions of candid\n are exposed to denial of service by causing the decoding to run \nindefinitely until the canister traps due to reaching maximum \ninstruction limit per execution round. Repeated exposure to the payload \nwill result in degraded performance of the canister. Note: Canisters written in Motoko are unaffected.\n\nPublication Date: Mon Dec 02 18:02:09 2024\n\n#CVE #Vulnerability",

            "post_title": "Understanding Hackers vs. Hacktivists: Myths and Realities\n\n1). In today's digital landscape, the term \"hacker\" often carries a negative connotation, typically associated with scams. However, it's crucial to differentiate between various types of hackers. Simply stating \"I’m a hacker\" does not inherently imply malicious intent; Many individuals claim to be hackers, often adopting hoodie imagery and online personas. However, they may simply be enthusiasts or learners fascinated by hacking culture, lacking the skills or experience of true hackers. Their identity is more about admiration than expertise.\n\n⚡️Black hats are individuals who engage in unethical hacking or marketing practices, often exploiting systems for personal gain. They are hard to find on social media due to their use of anonymity, fake profiles, and sophisticated tactics to evade detection.\n\n2). Conversely, hacktivists identify as such because their motivations align with activism. They utilize hacking techniques to promote social change, fight for human rights, and challenge oppressive regimes. Hacktivism is rooted in a moral framework that seeks to expose corruption and injustice, often at significant personal risk. Notably, hacktivists do not engage in scams or financial fraud; their goals are driven by a sense of duty to advocate for the marginalized. \n\n⚡️Gray Hats are hackers who operate in a moral gray area, sometimes violating laws but without malicious intent. They often identify as hacktivists because they expose vulnerabilities to promote awareness or social change, balancing ethics with technical skill.\n\n3). Ethical hackers are cybersecurity professionals who test and secure systems by identifying vulnerabilities before malicious hackers exploit them. They operate with permission, using their skills to protect organizations and improve security protocols, ultimately contributing to a safer digital environment.\n\n⚡️White Hats are ethical hackers who help organizations improve their cybersecurity by identifying and fixing vulnerabilities. They operate legally and with permission, ensuring systems are secure from malicious attacks while promoting a safer digital environment.\n\n- Hackers Factory \n\n#grayhats\nhttps://t.me/InfoSecInsider",
